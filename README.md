# ðŸŒ¿ Virtual Herbal Garden

Virtual Herbal Garden is an interactive, 3D simulation of a realistic herbal garden that allows users to explore, learn about, and experiment with different plants. This project combines coding, 3D modeling, and AI chatbot interaction to provide an engaging and educational experience for plant enthusiasts, students, and researchers.

## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. ðŸŒ± Realistic 3D Garden Environment

Interactive Plant Models: Each plant is represented by a high-quality 3D model that can be rotated, zoomed, and viewed from multiple angles, allowing users to explore the garden as if it were real.
Plant Navigator: The virtual garden includes a navigation tool to help users search for specific plants or explore categories of herbs. This navigator enhances usability, ensuring users can easily find and learn about the herbs they are interested in.
